We wrote an R package 'realEstAnalytics', which provides an R function for each Zillow API service, making it easy to make API calls and process the response into convenient, R-friendly data structures. 

We will also build a Shiny app, which allows users to choose parameters they care about, then score and rank US counties to buy a house. We would set parameter bars such as Air Quality, Income, Living Cost, Income/Cost ratio, crime rate, the population in our shiny app. We would need multiple data sources for this purpose.
