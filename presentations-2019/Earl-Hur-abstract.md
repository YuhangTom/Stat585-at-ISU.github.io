Adopting a pet from an animal shelter is a great idea, but is a stressful process. 
Our R package petfindr will allow users to make pet searching an easier process.

Our package is an R client for the Petfinder API which collects pet data from petfinder.com. We have written functions to allow R users to access the Petfinder API and provide useful tools to users to find their new furry friends that fit the user's preferences (e.g., dogs or cats, breeds, age, gender, etc.) from the user's accessible location. 
We have also built a Shiny application for visualization, such as creating an interactive map of animal shelters (to show where the pets are located) with pictures of the pets and descriptions of the pets (with pop-up text).
