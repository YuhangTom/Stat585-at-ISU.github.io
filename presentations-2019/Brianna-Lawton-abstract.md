Salary data for Iowa State University employees is publicly available through the state government. We've developed Cychecks, an R package, for the purpose of examining and interpreting this dataset. This package will allow users to compare pay between genders, positions, and departments, for instance, and display the results in a dynamic interface. While this data is publicly available, we also understand that salaries are sensitive, personal information and therefore we will be anonymizing all names. We hope Cychecks will provide useful fodder for discussing pay patterns within a publicly funded university.
