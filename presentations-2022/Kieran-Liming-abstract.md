pitcheR is a package designed to take Statcast data (detailed pitch by pitch data from MLB games) and easily visualize it in graphics that are interpretable and useful for anyone looking into big league pitchers. The package can also find trends over time, either game to game or over certain dates, for a pitchers descriptive statistics which helps us look deeper into how the pitcher is throwing the ball.
