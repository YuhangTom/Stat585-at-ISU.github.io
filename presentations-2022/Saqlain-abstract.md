The goal of the package ‘aliapp’ is to visualize and explore the 1973 US Arrests data using an interactive dashboard made by R and Shiny. The dataset used here is an in-built dataset in base R. The Shiny app has functionalities to visualize crime rates of different arrests statewise with the help of a bar chart as well as a colour-themed map.
